# Screen_Pilot
An AI desktop assistant that listens and watches. Use voice commands to control your PC—it analyzes your screen with computer vision, opens folders ("Show me 'My Projects'"), types messages ("Type 'Hello' in WhatsApp"), or clicks buttons—all hands-free. Perfect for lazy power users. Built with Whisper (voice), YOLO (UI detection), and PyAutoGUI.
